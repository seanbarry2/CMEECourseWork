rainfall = (('JAN',111.4),
            ('FEB',126.1),

            ('MAY', 71.8),
            ('JUN', 70.2),
            ('JUL', 97.1),
            ('AUG',140.2),

# (1) Use a list comprehension to create a list of month,rainfall tuples where
# the amount of rain was greater than 100 mm.
 
# (2) Use a list comprehension to create a list of just month names where the
# amount of rain was less than 50 mm. 

# (3) Now do (1) and (2) using conventional loops (you can choose to do 
# this before 1 and 2 !). 

# A good example output is:
#
# Step #1:
# Months and rainfall values when the amount of rain was greater than 100mm:
# [('JAN', 111.4), ('FEB', 126.1), ('AUG', 140.2), ('NOV', 128.4), ('DEC', 142.2)]
# ... etc.

# Finding months where rainfall exceeds 100mm using list comprehensions

more_than_100mm = [(month, rain) for month, rain in rainfall if rain > 100]
print(more_than_100mm)

# Finding months where rainfall is below 50mm using same method

less_than_50mm = [(month, rain) for month, rain in rainfall if rain < 50]
print(less_than_50mm)
