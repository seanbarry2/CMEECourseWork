# explanation of line 37-40
# initial_condition_names gets the names of all initial conditions in the list
# selected_condition goes through all 'iter' values (from 0-100) and assigns them to 1, 2, 3 or 4, which correspond to each of the conditions
# it does this by doing (iter - 1) %% 4 + 1, %% finds the remainder of (iter - 1) / 4
# this means that if iter = 1, then (1 - 1) %% 4 = 0 and since R indexing starts at 1 we add + 1
# we do iter - 1 so that the indexing starts at 0 + 1 and not 2, you could theoretically do iter %% 4 + 1 and it would work fine, but it would start as 2, 3, 4, 1
