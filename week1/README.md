Project: Week 1 
Description: Includes all files used to learn the basics of UNIX, shell scripting and Latex.

Languages: 
shell / bash scripting

Structure:
Unix and linux basics included the creation of all directories, including CMEECourseWork, week1, code, data, results and sandbox. Additional files relating to UNIX basics include all "TestFile", "Test", "File" and "spawnnxs.txt". The main practical involving UNIX is stored under "code" and named "UnixPrac1.txt". In this practical 5 tasks had to be solved with commands (all info regarding this can be found in the file). Shell scripting files include "MyExampleScript.sh", "boilerplate.sh", "variables.sh", "tabtocsv.sh", "ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh" and "tiff2png.sh". The shell scripting practical involved writing a script that changes csv-delimited files to space-delimited files. Using the script, 4 csv files were changed to space delimited. LaTeX basics included making a basic pdf file with a bibliography, by using a templates provided on the MulQuaBio which were saved locally as "FirstExample.tex" and "Firstbiblio.bib". Then an accompanying bash script (CompileLaTeX.sh) was made and the final pdf (FirstExample.pdf) was created. All data was then pushed to git by following the guide on the MulQuaBio.
