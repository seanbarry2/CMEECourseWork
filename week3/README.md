**Week 3 Readme - Basics in R and Jupyter notebook**

This project focuses on teaching the basics of data wrangling and visualization in R. Key objectives include structuring raw data, making Rscripts, automating data manipulation, and producing clear, reproducible visualizations to reveal trends within the dataset. Additionally, a brief introduction into Jupyter notebook was completed, where the layout and basic usage of the program were clarified.

**Languages**
R (v4.x)

**Dependencies**
tidyverse – for comprehensive data manipulation and visualization
reshape2 – for transforming data between wide and long formats
ggplot2 (included in tidyverse) – for data visualization

**Files**
DataWrang.R: Main script for data wrangling, used to teach most basic commands in R while also teaching the basics of 'wrangling' data in general. 
PoundHillData.csv: Raw data file containing species observations per quadrat, without headers. (Used as data for DataWrang.R)
PoundHillMetaData.csv: Metadata file containing descriptions of the variables and sampling structure.
EcolArchives-E089-52-D1.csv: Dataset that contains records of feeding interactions between predator and prey. (Used to teach basic plotting commands).
