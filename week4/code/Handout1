How	many	repeats	are	there	per	bird	per	year?

bird_repeats <- data %>%
  group_by(BirdID, Year) %>%
  summarise(Count = n()) %>%
  ungroup()

print(bird_repeats)

How	many	individuals	did	we	capture	per	year	for	each	sex?	Compute	the	numbers,	
devise	a	useful	table	format,	and	fill	it	in.

indiv_counts <- data %>%
  group_by(Year, Sex) %>%
  summarise(Individuals_Captured = n_distinct(BirdID)) %>%
  ungroup()

print(indiv_counts)

individual_counts_wide <- indiv_counts %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Sex, values_from = Individuals_Captured, values_fill = 0)

print(individual_counts_wide)

Think	about	how	you	can	communicate	(1)	and	(2)	best	in	tables,	and	how	you	can
visualise	(1)	and	(2) using	plots.	Produce several	solutions,	and	discuss with	GTA	
and	your	peers which	the	pros	and	cons	for	each	solution	to	communicate	and	
visualize	the data	structure	for	(1)	and	(2).



Write	two	results	sections	for	(1)	and	(2),	and	ask	your	GTA	for	feedback.	Each	
result	section	should	use	different	means	of	communicating	the	results,	visually	and	
in	a	table.
