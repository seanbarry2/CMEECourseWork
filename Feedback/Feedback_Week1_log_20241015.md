# Feedback on Project Structure and Code

## Project Structure

### Repository Organization
The project is well-structured, with appropriate directories for `code`, `data`, `results`, and `sandbox`. The inclusion of a `.gitignore` file is excellent, as it helps keep the repository clean by ignoring unnecessary files. However, the main `README.md` file is quite minimal and could benefit from more detailed instructions on how to run the scripts, as well as a breakdown of what each script does.

### README Files
The `README.md` file in the parent directory provides a high-level description of the project but lacks detail. It would be helpful to expand it with usage examples for the scripts, expected inputs, and outputs, as well as any dependencies or system requirements.

## Workflow
The workflow demonstrates good organization, with code, data, and results kept separate. This makes it easy to follow and maintain. The results directory is empty, which is a good practice as results should not be tracked in version control. However, including some explanation in the `README.md` about how to generate results and where they are stored would improve usability.

## Code Syntax & Structure

### Shell Scripts
1. **MyExampleScript.sh:**
   - The script works as expected, printing a greeting using the `$USER` environment variable. It is simple and functional.

2. **UnixPrac1.txt:**
   - This script processes `.fasta` files, handling tasks like counting lines and calculating the AT/GC ratio. The logic is clear, but adding comments for each step would improve readability and make it easier for others to follow.

3. **CountLines.sh:**
   - The script counts the number of lines in a file. However, it encounters an issue when no file is provided, which could be handled more gracefully by checking the input before proceeding:
     ```bash
     if [ -z "$1" ]; then
       echo "Error: No file provided"
       exit 1
     fi
     ```

4. **Variables.sh:**
   - The script demonstrates how to use variables effectively. However, it uses `expr` for arithmetic, which is outdated. It is recommended to use `$((...))` for arithmetic operations:
     ```bash
     MY_SUM=$(($a + $b))
     ```

5. **TabToCSV.sh:**
   - The script works well, converting tab-delimited files to CSV. It includes good error handling, checking for file existence and proper input. No major issues were found.

6. **CSVToSpace.sh:**
   - This script correctly converts CSV files to space-separated values. The input validation is solid, and error messages are clear. However, it could check if the output file already exists to avoid overwriting without warning.

7. **Tiff2PNG.sh:**
   - The script converts `.tif` files to `.png` format but fails when no `.tif` files are found. Adding a check to ensure `.tif` files are present before running the `convert` command would prevent errors.

8. **CompileLaTeX.sh:**
   - This script compiles a LaTeX file and cleans up auxiliary files. However, it encounters errors when certain auxiliary files are not present. Using `rm -f` instead of `rm` would avoid errors when files donâ€™t exist:
     ```bash
     rm -f *.aux *.log *.bbl *.blg
     ```

9. **Boilerplate.sh:**
   - A simple script that runs as expected, printing messages to the console. No issues were found.

10. **ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh:**
    - This script concatenates two input files into a third file. It handles input validation well but could benefit from checking if the output file already exists before overwriting it.

### LaTeX Files
1. **FirstExample.tex & FirstBiblio.bib:**
   - These files are well-structured, and the LaTeX file compiles correctly with the provided bibliography. No issues were found with the document formatting.

## Suggestions for Improvement
- **Error Handling:** Across multiple scripts, improving error handling by checking for file existence and preventing overwriting of files would enhance robustness.
- **Modernization:** Replace outdated practices like using `expr` for arithmetic with `$((...))` for better readability and performance.
- **Comments:** Adding more comments, especially in complex scripts like `UnixPrac1.txt`, would help others understand the logic and flow of the code.
- **README Enhancements:** The `README.md` could be expanded to include more detailed instructions, usage examples, and explanations for each script.

## Overall Feedback
The project is well-organized, and the scripts are functional. With a few minor improvements in error handling, modernization of shell scripting practices, and more detailed README documentation, the project will be even more robust and user-friendly. Overall, it demonstrates a solid understanding of shell scripting and project structure.
